This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Liu CY, Xiao C, Fraser SE, Lester HA, Koos DS (2012)
Electrophysiological characterization of Grueneberg ganglion olfactory
neurons: spontaneous firing, sodium conductance, and
hyperpolarization-activated currents. J Neurophysiol 108:1318-34

This is the NEURON code that was used by the paper authors.
NEURON is available for free at http://www.neuron.yale.edu

This model does not contain any mod files so you can start simulations
by double clicking the init.hoc file (mswin), dragging and dropping
the init.hoc file on nrngui (mac) or typing "nrngui init.hoc" on the
command line (unix/linux).
